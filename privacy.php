<p>
    <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
</p>
<p>
    White Knight Safety Solutions Inc. (“<strong>White Knight</strong>”/“<strong>we</strong>”/”<strong>us</strong>”) is committed to protecting your privacy.
    We make the website, HYPERLINK "http://whiteknightsafety.com/" http://whiteknightsafety.com/ (the “<strong>Website</strong>”) available together with our
    White Knight Safety Solutions mobile application (the “<strong>App</strong>”) together with our services as further described in our Terms of Use
    www.whiteknightsafety.com (the “<strong>Services</strong>”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our
    users through the Website, the App and the Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Consent: By using the Website, the App or our Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy
    </strong>
    . Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We will not actively
    collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual. In other words, we don’t sell
    customer lists. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your
    inability to continue using the Website, the App and/or the Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Collection of Information: </strong>
    We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our
    customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for service improvement and
    advancement. We will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us on signing up for our Services or contacting us with
    questions or for further information and we will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we
    have listed below), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.
</p>
<p>
    Two types of information may be collected through the Website, the App and our Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy
    Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a)
    information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a directory or made available
    through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).
</p>
<p>
    "<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card
    information, birth date and gender. At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will
    be used. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information,
    in some instances you may not be able to register to use the Website, the App or the Services or be able to access and use them at all. In other instances,
    your choice not to provide certain other Personal Information may mean that you will not be able to use certain features of the Website, the App and the
    Services. We may collect Personal Information through registration processes; communications with you; information downloads; service use; device location;
    user support; and surveys.
</p>
<p>
    "<strong><em>Non-Personal Information</em></strong>" is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain
    used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by visitors to the Website. Aggregate information, such as
    demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and
    average time spent on the Website is not considered Personal Information. Similarly, business contact information such as the name, title, business
    address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the
    extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy
    about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website, the App and the Services. Such
    Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this Website, the App and the Services. For example, our web servers may
    automatically collect Non-Personal Information that is provided through your browser or stored in a cookie when you choose to visit the Website.
