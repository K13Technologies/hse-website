        <h3>Innovation In Extreme Environments</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges our software engineers faced was syncing the data from the app with the dashboard. Working in remote areas with limited network connectivity or no network connectivity at all proved to be technically challenging. The software engineers must take into account a harsh environment prior to the design stage of development. The specific environmental conditions in which the product will be used will affect the product specifications, and has to be determined beforehand.  Our process used a combination of intense field testing in the oil fields of Northern Alberta with safety and field personnel. Coupled with innovative technical solutions we have created a powerful health and safety solution for your company.</p>
